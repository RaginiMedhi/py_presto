The R package "immunogenomics/presto" (refer to: https://github.com/immunogenomics/presto) provides Wilcoxon rank sum test and auROC analyses for single cell RNA-seq data which are inherently sparse.

Here, the functions have been adapted to be compatible with python and to ensure analyses of single cell matrices in python.

Instructions for implementation are provided as "python_presto_tutorial.ipynb" in the code folder.

If you use this and the original implementation, citing the work will be very much appreciated!!
